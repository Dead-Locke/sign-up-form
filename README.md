### Learning Outcomes: 
- Learned how to structure a basic form and best orientation practices. 
- Learned that short forms are often better at acomplishing their goals, and asking for unnecessary information is detrimental to user experience and user retention.  
- Learned about form elements and how to properly use them for basic validation and restriction of user input. 
- Learned basic regex pattern matching.
- Learned about form design principles regarding user feedback during validation, specifically the importance of consistent, immediate feedback during data entry. 

- Learned how to use Java-Script to implement basic Client-Side validation. 
- For some reason, functions  called within addEventListener need to be nested within an anonymous function if those functions have any arguments passed into them.
